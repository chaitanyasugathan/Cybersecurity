# Red Team vs. Blue Team

Project involved working on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst. The tasks involved :
- As the Red Team member, attack a vulnerable VM within the environment and ultimately gaining root access to the machine.
- As Blue Team member, use Kibana to review logs captured during the previous engagement and to extract hard data and visualizations for the report.
- Finally, to interpret the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that was successfully performed.


## Skills and tools used

- Penetration testing with Kali Linux
- Log and incident analysis with Kibana
- System hardening and configuration
- Reporting, documentation, and communication
